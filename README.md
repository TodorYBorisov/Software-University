# Software-University
The "Programming Basics" course provides the initial programming skills necessary for all technology majors at Software University. This includes writing programming code at an entry level (basic coding skills), working with a development environment (IDE), using variables and data, operators and expressions, working with the console (reading input data and printing results), using conditional constructs (if, if-else) and loops (for, while, do-while).

The course "Programming Fundamentals" students begin to study SoftUni's in-house program for comprehensive training of software engineers. The course examines fundamental concepts in programming, which are the basis for effective and quality training in the professional modules. Learners build on the knowledge gained in the Programming Basics course and begin to use more complex programming concepts and structures such as: arrays, sheets, objects and classes. Additional technologies needed by every software developer are studied, such as HTML and CSS, HTTP, bitwise operations, and more. The basics of web development are covered, as well as one of the most common technologies and tools, with which the course successfully builds an idea among students about the upcoming professional modules and the knowledge they will gain from them to become successful software developers.

In the "JS Advanced" course, you will get a deep knowledge of the JavaScript language, such as the basics of syntax, working with arrays, matrices, objects, classes and writing functions. You will study more complex concepts like function context, explicit binding, event loop. The course will develop your algorithmic thinking. After successful completion of this course, you will be able to work with the DOM tree, do manipulations on it and work with "events". Functional and OOP approaches to JavaScript programming will be explored, studying concepts such as inheritance, object composition, and prototype chaining.

In the course "JS Applications" you will learn what HTTP requests are and how to use them. You will learn about REST Services, what a Baas (backend as a service) is and how to work with it, what asynchronous code means (Promises, using async/await), what Templating and Routing are. During the course, you will create a Single Page Application, using the techniques learned from previous lectures, on which you will be assessed. You will understand what is the architecture of an application and how to properly structure your applications. By the end of the course, you'll explore different design patterns and their practical guidelines, create your own web components using the Web Components standard, and build a Webback environment from scratch.
